# PyTorch Boilerplate Code

## Introduction
This is a repository that covers PyTorch Boilerplate Code covering the full metrics from datasets, models, metrics etc.

Feel free to use the code and let me know aobut any bugs and issues that you find.

## Current Plans
- [ ] Add requirements.txt
- [ ] Metrics Support(Recall, Precision etc.)
- [ ] Computer Vision
    - [ ] Image Classification
        - [ ] Add Timm Support
        - [x] CNN Models
        - [ ] Transformer Models
            - [ ] Modify Existing training loop to be more flexible for differeent tasks and models
            - [ ] Implement Custom Transformer model like ViT
    - [ ] Semantic Segmentation
    - [ ] Object Detection
    - [ ] Instance Segmentation
- [ ] Natural Language Processing
